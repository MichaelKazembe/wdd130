Interview Summary
I interviewed Pastor Marcus Daniel, a senior pastor at Raised for a Purpose (RFP) Ministries, who is also an experienced HR professional. Although he transitioned to full-time ministry, his work still involves significant writing tasks. Pastor Marcus shared that he spends approximately 40% of his time writing, whether it’s preparing sermons, composing emails, writing quarterly reports, or drafting proposals for church programs and initiatives. He observed that sermon preparation is particularly time-consuming. Before the final message, he researches his topic of choice, which involves taking notes and references from various sources. Then he makes sure to craft the message effectively while connecting emotionally and spiritually with his congregation. Pastor Marcus expressed confidence in his writing skills, attributing it to his years of professional experience as an HR. He explained that strong writing skills are critical in his role because they ensure clarity and professionalism, whether communicating with church members or external stakeholders during his consultations. He emphasized that strong writing abilities enhance credibility and help build trust within his ministry. He also mentioned that effective communication is vital for sharing the church’s vision.From this interview, I learned that writing is a vital skill, especially in spreading the gospel. Strong writing abilities enhance one's ability to inspire, persuade, and inform. Whether preparing a sermon, a memo, or drafting an email, writing not only facilitates communication but also strengthens personal and professional relationships. For someone pursuing a career in software development, this reinforces the value of harnessing the power of writing ability, as it will play a key role in documentation, proposals, and teamwork.
