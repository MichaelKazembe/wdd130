      <!-- ABOUT ME -->
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Michael Kazembe. You can call me MK. I am from Malawi,
        a small country in the south eastern part of Africa. I am a student at
        Brigham Young University(BYU)-Idaho. I am studying Software Development.
        I am currently taking a Web Design and Development course. I am excited
        to learn more about web development. I have a passion for creating
        user-friendly websites and applications. My journey in tech started with
        a love for problem-solving and innovation. I also enjoy collaborating
        with others to bring ideas to life. Outside of tech, I appreciate
        exploring new cultures and spending time with family. I am excited to
        see where this journey takes me. I believe technology has the power to
        make a positive impact on people's lives. My goal is to use my skills to
        create solutions that address real-world challenges. I am constantly
        looking for opportunities to grow and improve in my field. This course
        is another step toward achieving my dreams in the tech industry.
